# Jest

##  JavaScript testing framework

Jest is a JavaScript testing framework developed by Facebook. It supports unit, integration, and end-to-end testing. Features include a built-in test runner, mocking, snapshot testing, and code coverage. Jest's simplicity and rich feature set make it popular for React and other JavaScript applications.

##  Zero configuration setup

Jest offers zero configuration setup for testing, enabling developers to get started quickly. It automatically finds and runs tests without requiring extensive setup. With built-in test runners, assertion libraries, and mocking capabilities, Jest simplifies testing workflows, making it ideal for seamless integration into projects with minimal configuration.

## JavaScript Snapshot testing

Jest's snapshot testing captures the rendered output of components or functions and saves it as a reference. During future test runs, Jest compares current output to saved snapshots to detect unexpected changes. This helps ensure that UI and function outputs remain consistent, simplifying regression testing and visual verification.

## Unit and integration testing

Jest supports unit and integration testing by allowing developers to write and run tests for individual functions or components (unit tests) and for interactions between multiple components or systems (integration tests). It provides tools for mocking, asserting, and organizing tests to ensure code correctness and reliability.
